# Stuck In A Dungeon
## Introduction
This is the projects done after every module in the course provided by Andrew Ng's DeepLearning.ai. There are 4 projects in total, including topics:

1. Transfer learning
2. Object Detection
3. Image segmentation
4. Visualization and Interpretability

## Project Details
* #### Transfer Learning:
  Objective: Retrain RetinaNet to spot Zombies using just 5 training images.
  Task: Setup the model to restore pretrained weights and fine tune the classification layers.
  Results: The boxes my model generated match 99.58% of the ground truth boxes with a relative tolerance of 0.3.
  
* #### Object Detection
  
* #### Image Segmentation:
  
* #### Visualization and Interpretability:
